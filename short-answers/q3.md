# Question

Why would you want to use a `\b` character class instead of a `\s` character class?

# Answer

You want to use `\b` in the beginning and end of the RegEx in word to put boundaries between the RegEx in order to match whole words inside of the string. You want to use `\s` to match on spaces inside of the RegEx.

# Question

What's an example of when RegEx would solve a problem that would be difficult to solve with other tools?

# Answer

An example of when RegEx would solve a problem that would be difficult to solve with other tools is if you want to remove multiple chararcters from a string. If you use RegEx, you can define the characters through replace then use the `.replace` method to iterate through the string in a fast way. The inefficent alternative to this would be doing a for loop for each character, which will be significantly longer.
